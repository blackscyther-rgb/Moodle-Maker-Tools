# Moodle-Maker-Tools
 These tools help to create various content to be used in Moodle specifically - but could be used anywhere a HTML editor appears

# Banner Maker

This is the first tool being developed. This allows for quick and easy 'banners' to be created which will allow you to clearly distinguish between the different content on the page. It allows the user to specify the colour of the banner, one of two styles (including text colour), and the use of a font-awesome icon.

Credits:
This tool uses:
- The 'jscolor' library (https://jscolor.com/) 
- The FontAwesome IconPicker (https://github.com/itsjavi/fontawesome-iconpicker) to incorporate more easily Font Awesome icons. 
- The CSS 'selector' code for choosing the capping with an image instead of radio buttons (https://jsfiddle.net/teocci/Lnt9quLu/).
